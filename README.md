SEE: https://course.fast.ai/ to learn exactly what the heck is happening here. (Lesson 2 I think)

Open these files in Colaboratory. If you don't know what that is.. what are you doing here.

FILES:

fruits_main       --    Includes everything from uploading images,training the model and testing it using user provided images.

fruits_pretrained --    Just for testing. No need to sit through the training process.
